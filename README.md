# Country Scraper

This is a Python-based web scraping project that extracts structured country data from a public-facing website. The script, `scrapetest.py`, uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to collect information such as country names, links, and related metadata, and then organizes the data into a pandas DataFrame for export.

## Features

- Uses `BeautifulSoup` for parsing and `requests` for HTTP calls
- Outputs data to CSV or DataFrame format
- Designed to be modular and easily extensible

## Technologies Used
